# Text Summarizer
***Seq2Seq Model***

Nowadays, in every field, feedbacks are necessary. If someone's review/feedback is very long and descriptive, it will be time-consuming to analyze it manually. So what this application does, it takes the review as an input and generates the summary of few words. <br />

## Datasets
I've trained the model on Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset, you can to download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews).
